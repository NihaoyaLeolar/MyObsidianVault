## 阅读体会【500字】
本文是比较早期的时序数据挖掘技术的综述，对数据挖掘技术的各个方面有比较全面且基础的介绍，让我快速入门这个领域。
时间序列数据具有数值性和连续性的特点，总是被视为一个整体，而不是单个数值域。因此，与传统数据库中基于精确匹配的相似性搜索不同，时间序列数据中的相似性搜索通常以近似的方式进行。领域内的研究可以分为五大部分：时间序列表示与索引、相似性搜索策略、分段、数据挖掘、可视化。其中，数据挖掘与可视化是最终需要的最核心部分，前面的部分均为分析过程手段，数据挖掘中最重要的内容为模式发现。
以上，每个部分均有大量现有研究，有传统的解决方案以及针对特定领域的特殊方法。具体情况需要对系统进行准确分析，然后选择与设计。通过阅读本文，让我快速了解本领域各个部分的要点，以及研究内容。方便后续参考，快速进入特定部分进行研究。但是由于本文不是近年产出，还需要继续查看近期的领域研究文献，全面了解领域发展。


#### 时序性数据与传统数据对比的特点：
The nature of time series data includes: **large in data size, high dimensionality and update continuously.** Moreover time series data, which is characterized by its numerical and continuous nature, is always considered as a whole instead of individual numerical ﬁeld. Therefore, unlike traditional databases where similarity search is **exact** match based, similarity search in time series data is typically carried out in an **approximate** manner.
### 1. Time series representation and indexing
### 2. Similarity measure
#### Whole sequence matching
>Query1: find all stocks which behave ‘similar’ to stock A.
##### Distance Function
To measure the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series, the most popular approach is to evaluate the **Euclidean distance(欧式距离)** on the transformed representation like the DFT coefficients  and the DWT coefficients .

#### Subsequence matching
>Query2: find all ‘head and shoulders’ patterns last for a month in the closing prices of all high-tech stocks.
### 3. Segmentation
Time series segmentation can be considered either as a **preprocessing step** for variety of data mining tasks or as **trend analysis techniques**. It is also considered as a discretization problem.
Unlike transactional databases with discrete items, time series data is characterized by their numerical and continuous nature.
### 4. Visualization

### 5. Mining in time series
Mining is the final goal to discover hidden information or knowledge from either the original or the transformed time series data. 
#### pattern discovery 
is the most common mining task
>模式发现: 通常在数据挖掘和机器学习领域中被广泛使用，是指从大量的数据中自动搜索出有意义的规律、模式或趋势的过程。这些模式可以是频繁出现的项集、子序列或其他数据结构。
>在时间序列数据中，模式发现特指寻找数据中重复出现的或具有某种特定结构的子序列。这些子序列可能代表某种重要的、有意义的事件或行为。

#### clustering method 
is the most commonly method. 
#### classiﬁcation
#### rule mining
#### summarization
